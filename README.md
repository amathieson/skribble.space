> [!note]    
> By default, it will expose the application over your network. Meaning it probably isn't safe to use in a public café, etc.
> To disable, comment out the following lines in **vite.config.js**:
> ```js  
> server: {
>    host: '0.0.0.0'
>    port: 5173
> }
> ```

## Thanks to:
Adam, who has done all the hard work, purely because I was complaining I couldn't find mindmapping software I liked on iOS. Love you 💜
